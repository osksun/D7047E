2.1 Transfer Learning from ImageNet



AlexNet accuracy on CIFAR10: 13.890%

AlexNet accuracy on CIFAR10 using pretrained model: 86.750% 

The difference is that in the first run we trained the model ourselves on the CIFAR10 dataset with untrained neurons
while the second run downloads a pretrained model and trains on neurons that has already been trained on before.



2.2 Transfer Learning from MNIST

CNN_basic accuracy on SVHN: 14.916%

CNN_basic accuracy on MNIST:

CNN_basic trained on MNIST loaded and trained on SVHN: 30,032%
